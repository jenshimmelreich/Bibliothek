## Frame of a Technological Investigation
"How to frame a technological investigation? By sticking to the framework and the limits indicated by the interviewes thenselves." (18)

## Content of Investigation
"If that indifference to the general 'framework' is shocking, let's say that our sociology prefers a local history whose framework is defined by the actors and not by the investigator. Our local history will talk about Aramis, not about guided transportation, nechnical couplings, or monopolistic state capitalism. On the other hand, it will let the actor add whatever they choose to the framework; it will let them take it as far as they care to go." (19)

## Technological project as a fiction
"By definition, a technological project is a fiction, since at the outset it does not exist, and there is no way it can exist yet because it is in the project phase." (23)

## From signs to things
"The observer of technologies has to be very careful not to differentiate too hastily between signs and things, between projects and objects, between fiction and reality, between a novel about feelings and what is inscribed in the nature of things. In fact, the engineers the observer is studying pass progressively from one of these sets to another." (24)

## Fiction with 'variable geometry'
"A fiction with 'variable geometry' [gains or loses reality]: this is what needs to be invented, if we are to track the variations of a technological project that has the potential to become an object." (24f)

## Heterogenous engineering
"He's [Bardet - engineer, first patents on aramis] a sociologist as well as a technican. Let's say that he's a sociotechnician, and that he relies on a particular form of ingenuity, heterogeneous engineering, which lead him to blend together major social questions concerning the spririt of the age or the century and 'properly' technological questions in a single discourse." (33)

## How innovation arise
"People always wonder how a laboratory, or a science, can have any impact at all on society, or how an innovation arises in the mind of its inventors. The answer is always to be found in the chains of translation that transfrom a global problem (the city, the century) into a local problem (kinematics, contiuous transportation) through a series of intermediaries that are not 'logical' in the formal sense of the term, but that oblige those, like DATAR [regional planning comission], who are interested in the global problem to become interested, through almost imperceptible shifts, in the local solution." (33)

## Generating interests
"The work of generating interest consists in constructing these long chains of reasons that are irresistible, even though their logical form may be debatable. If vou want to save the city, save Bardet. This implication is not logically correct, but it is socio-logically accurate." (33)

## Innovation
"Innovation always comes from a blending or redistribution of properties that previously had been dispersed." (36)

## Actors
"The 'market forces' of the private sector are actors like the others." (41)

## Assemblies of spokespersons
"In preference to cumbersome notions such as market forces or the irresistible thrust of technology, let's choose assemblies of spokespersons who bring together, during a single meeting, around a single table, different worlds." (42)

## Varying size of actors
"The actors come in varying sizes; this is the whole problem with innovation." (44)

## Size of the actors
"In a project's history, the suspense derives form the swelling or shrinking of the relative size of the actors.
Although this variability can never be eliminated, its scope can nevertheless be limited. Here is where law comes into its own. No technolgy wthout rules, whtout signatures, whithout bureaucracies and stamps." (45)

## Becoming more real
"But by accumulating little solidities, little durablilities, little resistances, the project ends up gradually becoming somewhat more real." (47)

## Essence of a project
"There is no such thing as the essence of a project. Only finished products have an essence. For technology, too, 'existence precedes essence.'" (48)

## Sociogram - Technogram
"So if you don't want the transportation system to turn back into a beet field, you habe to add to the task of interesting humans the task of interesting and attaching nonhumans. To the sociogram, which charts human interests and translations, you have to add the technogram, which charts the interests and atttachments of nonhumans." (58)

## Men and things
"Men and things exchange properties and replace one another; this is what gives technological projects their full savor." (61)

## Actor
"When our engineers cross the qualities of drivers with the qualities of automatic pilots and central computers, they're embarking on the definition of a character." (62)

## Project Management
"The frontier between 'the bulk of the work' and 'fine-tuning details' remains in flux for a long time; its position is the object of intense negotiation. To simplify its task, every group tends to think that its own role is most important, and that the next group in the chain just needs to concern itself with the technical details, or to apply the principles that the first group has defined. Moreover, this way of looking at things is integrated into project management; by going from what is less real to what is more real, you often divide up project into so-called phases: the conceptual phase, the feasibility phase, the scale-model phase, the full-system site study phase, the commercial-demonstration phase, the acceptance phase, the phases of qualification, manufacturing, and homologation." (67)

## Project Phases
"Consensus about the length, importance, and order of phases is not the general case. It is a special case - that of projects that work well. With difficult projects, it is impossible to rely on phases and their neat arrangements, since depending on the informant and the period, the project may shift from idea to reality or from reality to idea ..." (67)

## Innovatice Project
"A project is called innovative if the number of actors that have to be taken into account is not a given from the outset. If that number is known in advance, in contrast, the project can follow quite orderly, hierarchical phases; it can go from office to office, and every office will add the concerns of the actors for which it is responsible." (72)

## Unified Point of View
"VAL, because it exists, unifies points of view. [...] Since it [Aramis] does not exist, it cannot unify points of view." (77)

## Time of a Project
"The time frame for innovations depends on the geometry of the actors, not on the calendar. [...] All vou have to do is reconstruct the chain of permissions and refusals, alliances and losses, to understand that a project may not budge for a hundred year or that it may transform itself completely in four minutes flat. [...] Grab calendar time and you'll find yourself empty-handed. Grab the actors, and you'll get periodization and temporalization as a bonus." (88f)

## Sociotechnical View
"But wait a minute, some will object, we're dealing with technologies, not passions; with drawings, not plots; with logic, not sociology; with economic calculus, not Machiavellian calculations. Ah, but they're wrong! The two sets come together in research rooms and administrative council rooms, the pertinent question is not whether it's a matter of technology or society, but only what ist the best sociotechnological compromise." (101)

## Becoming Concrete
"In the first place it's abstract, since each element, once drawn in, once 'interested', pursuers its own goals and tries to conform as little as possible to the common translation. It becomes concrete only gradually, if it can count as one in the eyes of all its users, who are simply content to 'take Aramis' on the Petite Ceinture so they can go about their business." (106)

## Theories about Project Management
"People who study technological projects take too little interest in the official doctrines dealing with the actual mangement of the projects. This metalanguage appears parasitical. Yet it plays the same essential role that strategic doctrines play in the conduct of wars. In the course of a battle or a project, ideas about the way to handle battles or innovations play a performative role. [...] Writing a project's history also means writing the history of the ambient theories about project management. The history of technologies has to include the history of these doctrines, just as military history includes the history of the strategies taught in war colleges and at general headquarters." (113)

## Two Models of Innovation
"There are two models for studying innovations: the linear model and the whirlwind model. Or, if you prefer, the diffusion model and the translation model.
The two trajectories are quite different. In the first model, the initial idea emerges fully armed from the head of Zeus. [...] Such is the heroic narrative of technological innovation, a narrative of light and shadow in which the original object is complete and can only be degraded or maintained intact - allowing, of course, for a few minor adjustments. 
In the second model, the initial idea barely counts. It's a gadget, a whatchamacallit, a weakling at best, unreal in principle, ill-conceived from birth, constitutionally ineffective, A second difference stems from the first: the initial gadget is not endowed with autonomous power, nor is it boosted into the world by  a brilliant inventor. It has no inertia. A third difference stems from the first two. the initial gadget moves only if it interests one group or another, and it is impossible to tell whether these groups have petty interests or broad ones, whether they are open or resolutely closed to technological progress. They are what they are, and they want what they want. Period. So how, under these circumstances, can the whatchamacallit interest anyone at all? By translating, as we know, from antoher mode and into another language, the interests of these groups. Hence the fourth difference: every time a new group becomes interested in the project, it transforms the project - a little, a lot, excessively, or not at all. In the translation model, there is no transportation without transformation - except in those miraculous cases where everybody is in total agreement about a project, Hence the fifth and last difference: after many recruitments, displacmentes, and transformations, the project, having become real, then manifests, perhaps, the characteristics of perfection, profitability, beauty, and efficiency that the diffusion model located in the starting point." (118f)
## Context
"A technological project is not in a context; it gives itself a context, or sometimes does not give itself one.
What is required is not to 'replace projects in their context,' as the foolish expression goes, but to study the way the project is contexutalized or decontextualized. To do that, the regid, stuffy word 'context' has to be replaced by the supple, fiendly word 'network.'" (133)

## Context
"The impression of a context that surrounds the project comes from the fact that one forgets to count the handful of mediators who speak in the name of money, Official Bodies, chips, or voters." (134)

## Contextualizing
"The work of contextualizing makes the connection between a context and a project completely unforeseeable." (137)

## Context
"No, indeed, nothing happens by accident; but nothing happens by context either." (138)
