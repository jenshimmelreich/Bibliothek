## Frame of a Technological Investigation
"How to frame a technological investigation? By sticking to the framework and the limits indicated by the interviewes thenselves." (18)

## Content of Investigation
"If that indifference to the general 'framework' is shocking, let's say that our sociology prefers a local history whose framework is defined by the actors and not by the investigator. Our local history will talk about Aramis, not about guided transportation, nechnical couplings, or monopolistic state capitalism. On the other hand, it will let the actor add whatever they choose to the framework; it will let them take it as far as they care to go." (19)

## Technological project as a fiction
"By definition, a technological project is a fiction, since at the outset it does not exist, and there is no way it can exist yet because it is in the project phase." (23)

## From signs to things
"The observer of technologies has to be very careful not to differentiate too hastily between signs and things, between projects and objects, between fiction and reality, between a novel about feelings and what is inscribed in the nature of things. In fact, the engineers the observer is studying pass progressively from one of these sets to another." (24)

## Fiction with 'variable geometry'
"A fiction with 'variable geometry' [gains or loses reality]: this is what needs to be invented, if we are to track the variations of a technological project that has the potential to become an object." (24f)

## Heterogenous engineering
"He's [Bardet - engineer, first patents on aramis] a sociologist as well as a technican. Let's say that he's a sociotechnician, and that he relies on a particular form of ingenuity, heterogeneous engineering, which lead him to blend together major social questions concerning the spririt of the age or the century and 'properly' technological questions in a single discourse." (33)

## How innovation arise
"People always wonder how a laboratory, or a science, can have any impact at all on society, or how an innovation arises in the mind of its inventors. The answer is always to be found in the chains of translation that transfrom a global problem (the city, the century) into a local problem (kinematics, contiuous transportation) through a series of intermediaries that are not 'logical' in the formal sense of the term, but that oblige those, like DATAR [regional planning comission], who are interested in the global problem to become interested, through almost imperceptible shifts, in the local solution." (33)

## Generating interests
"The work of generating interest consists in constructing these long chains of reasons that are irresistible, even though their logical form may be debatable. If vou want to save the city, save Bardet. This implication is not logically correct, but it is socio-logically accurate." (33)

## Innovation
"Innovation always comes from a blending or redistribution of properties that previously had been dispersed." (36)

## Actors
"The 'market forces' of the private sector are actors like the others." (41)

## Assemblies of spokespersons
"In preference to cumbersome notions such as market forces or the irresistible thrust of technology, let's choose assemblies of spokespersons who bring together, during a single meeting, around a single table, different worlds." (42)

## Varying size of actors
"The actors come in varying sizes; this is the whole problem with innovation." (44)

## Size of the actors
"In a project's history, the suspense derives form the swelling or shrinking of the relative size of the actors.
Although this variability can never be eliminated, its scope can nevertheless be limited. Here is where law comes into its own. No technolgy wthout rules, whtout signatures, whithout bureaucracies and stamps." (45)

## Becoming more real
"But by accumulating little solidities, little durablilities, little resistances, the project ends up gradually becoming somewhat more real." (47)

## Essence of a project
"There is no such thing as the essence of a project. Only finished products have an essence. For technology, too, 'existence precedes essence.'" (48)

## Sociogram - Technogram
"So if you don't want the transportation system to turn back into a beet field, you habe to add to the task of interesting humans the task of interesting and attaching nonhumans. To the sociogram, which charts human interests and translations, you have to add the technogram, which charts the interests and atttachments of nonhumans." (58)

## Men and things
"Men and things exchange properties and replace one another; this is what gives technological projects their full savor." (61)

## Actor
"When our engineers cross the qualities of drivers with the qualities of automatic pilots and central computers, they're embarking on the definition of a character." (62)
