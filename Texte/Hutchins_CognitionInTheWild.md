## Team as a Cognitive and Computational System
"This book is an attempt to put cognition back into the social and cultural world. In doing this I hope to show that human cognition is not just influenced by culture and socitey, but that it is in a very fundamental sense a cultural and social process. To do this I will move the boundaries of the cogintive unit of analysis out beyond the skin of the individual person and treat the navigation team as a cognitive and computational system." (xiv)

## 1 Welcome aboard

## Fix Cycle
"The activities of The Navigation Department revolve around a computational ritual called the fix cycle. The fix cycle has two major parts: determining the present position of the ship and projecting its future position." (26)

## Official Description
"Of course it is not all in there, but the normative description in the Procedures is not a bad place to start. It is the Navigation department's 'official' version of the organization of its work. This document is one of many symbolic forms in which navigators 'represent themselves to themselves an to one another' (Geertz 1983).
[...] While conducting this exploration, we should keep in mind that the descriptions of navigation work that appear in a ship's documents and in various navigation publications must be taken as data rather than analysis." (27f)

## 2 Navigation as Computation

## Unit of Cognitive Analysis
"Having taken ship navigation as it is performed by a team on the bridge of a ship as the unit of cognitive analysis, I will attempt to apply the principal metaphor of cognitive science - cognition as computation - to the operation of this system. In so doing I do not make any special commitmnet to the nature of the computations that are going on inside individuals except to say that whatever happens there is part of a larger computational system. But I do believe that the computation observed in the activity of the larger system can be described in the way cognition has been traditionally described - that is, as computation realized through the creation, transformation, and propagation of representational states." (49)

## Marr's Distinction of Levels
"According to Marr, the most important three levels are as follows: the first level ist the computational theory of the task that the system performs. This level of description should specify what the system does and why it does it. [...] The second level of description concerns the 'choice of representation for the input and output and the algorithm to be used to transform one into the other.' [...] The third level concerns 'the details of how the algorithm and representation are realized physically.'" (50)

## Implementation Details
"The implementation details have been largely ignored in the past. This may be due in part to the notion that in informationprocessing systems what is important is the structure of the computation, not the means of implementation." (51)
