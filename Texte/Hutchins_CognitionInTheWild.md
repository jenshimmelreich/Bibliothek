## Team as a Cognitive and Computational System
"This book is an attempt to put cognition back into the social and cultural world. In doing this I hope to show that human cognition is not just influenced by culture and socitey, but that it is in a very fundamental sense a cultural and social process. To do this I will move the boundaries of the cogintive unit of analysis out beyond the skin of the individual person and treat the navigation team as a cognitive and computational system." (xiv)

## Fix Cycle
"The activities of The Navigation Department revolve around a computational ritual called the fix cycle. The fix cycle has two major parts: determining the present position of the ship and projecting its future position." (26)

## Official Description
"Of course it is not all in there, but the normative description in the Procedures is not a bad place to start. It is the Navigation department's 'official' version of the organization of its work. This document is one of many symbolic forms in which navigators 'represent themselves to themselves an to one another' (Geertz 1983).
[...] While conducting this exploration, we should keep in mind that the descriptions of navigation work that appear in a ship's documents and in various navigation publications must be taken as data rather than analysis." (27f)
