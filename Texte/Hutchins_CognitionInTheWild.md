## Team as a Cognitive and Computational System
"This book is an attempt to put cognition back into the social and cultural world. In doing this I hope to show that human cognition is not just influenced by culture and socitey, but that it is in a very fundamental sense a cultural and social process. To do this I will move the boundaries of the cogintive unit of analysis out beyond the skin of the individual person and treat the navigation team as a cognitive and computational system." (xiv)

## 1 Welcome aboard

## Fix Cycle
"The activities of The Navigation Department revolve around a computational ritual called the fix cycle. The fix cycle has two major parts: determining the present position of the ship and projecting its future position." (26)

## Official Description
"Of course it is not all in there, but the normative description in the Procedures is not a bad place to start. It is the Navigation department's 'official' version of the organization of its work. This document is one of many symbolic forms in which navigators 'represent themselves to themselves an to one another' (Geertz 1983).
[...] While conducting this exploration, we should keep in mind that the descriptions of navigation work that appear in a ship's documents and in various navigation publications must be taken as data rather than analysis." (27f)

## 2 Navigation as Computation

## Unit of Cognitive Analysis
"Having taken ship navigation as it is performed by a team on the bridge of a ship as the unit of cognitive analysis, I will attempt to apply the principal metaphor of cognitive science - cognition as computation - to the operation of this system. In so doing I do not make any special commitmnet to the nature of the computations that are going on inside individuals except to say that whatever happens there is part of a larger computational system. But I do believe that the computation observed in the activity of the larger system can be described in the way cognition has been traditionally described - that is, as computation realized through the creation, transformation, and propagation of representational states." (49)

## Marr's Distinction of Levels
"According to Marr, the most important three levels are as follows: the first level ist the computational theory of the task that the system performs. This level of description should specify what the system does and why it does it. [...] The second level of description concerns the 'choice of representation for the input and output and the algorithm to be used to transform one into the other.' [...] The third level concerns 'the details of how the algorithm and representation are realized physically.'" (50)

## Implementation Details
"The implementation details have been largely ignored in the past. This may be due in part to the notion that in informationprocessing systems what is important is the structure of the computation, not the means of implementation." (51)

## Relationship between Representational an Implementational Level
"In this light, the organitzation of systems of cultural representations may become visible and, once noticed, may come to seem much less obvious than before. Furthermore, because the representational ind implementational levels constrain each other more closely than do the comuptational and representational, it is useful to see the relationship between the representational level and its implemtation in cultures that are technologically quite different from each other." (66)

## Artifacts
"In the Western tradition, physical artifacts became repositories of konwledge, and they were constructed in durable media so that a single artifact might come to represent more than any individual could know. Furthermore, through the combination and superimposition of task-relevant structure, artifacts came to embody kinds of konwledge that would be exceedingly difficult to represent mentally (Latour 1986). Many of the instruments of Western navigation are based on the principle of building computational constraints of the task into the physical structure of the artifact." (96)

## Representation of Syntax
"The representation of symbolic worlds in physical artifacts, and especilally the representation of the syntax of such a world in the physical constraints of the artifact itself, is an enormously powerful principle." (107)

## Flow of Computational Products
"The tools of navigation share with one another a rich network of mutual computational and representational dependencies. Each plays a role in the computational environments of the others, providing the raw materials of computation or consuming the products of it. In the ecology of tools, based on the flow of computational products, each tool creates the environment for others. This is easy to see in the history of the physical tools, but the same is certainly true of the mental tools that navigators bring to their tasks." (113f)

## Thinking - Techniques and Tools
"A way of thinking comes with these techniques and tools. The advances that were made in naviagation were alwys parts of a surrounding culture. They appeared in other fields as well, so they come to permeate our culture. This is what makes it so difficult to see the nature of our way of doing things and to see how it is that other do what they do." (115)

## 3 The Implementation of Contemporary Pilotage

## Problemsolving
"In his seminal book The Scences of the Artificial Herbert Simon (1981: 153) said that 'solving a problem simply means representing it so as to make the solution transparent.'" (117)

## Fix Cycle
"The basic prodecures of navigation are accomplished by a cycle of activity, called the fix cycle, [...]" (117)

## Computation
"Since some of the structure involved in this computation is internal to the individuals and some external, it is useful to adopt a concept of computation that does not require a change of theory to cross the skin. The fix cycle is accomplished by the propagation of representational state across a series of representational media." (117)

## Representational State
"I will refer to a configuration of the elements of a medium that can be interpreted as a representation of something as a representational state of the medium. Representational states are propagated from one medium to another by bringing the states of the media into coordination with one another." (117)

## Computation
"For our purposes, 'computation' will be taken, in an broad sense, to refer to the propagation of representational state across representational media." (118)

## Problem solution
"What lies between the problem and its solution? Between the relation of the ship to its environment and the position plotted on the chart lie a number of representational media across which the representations of the spatial relationship of the ship to the world are propagated." (119)

## Internal organization
"With systems of socially distributed cognition we can step inside the cognitive system, and while some underlying processes (inside people's heads) remain obscured, a great deal of the internal organization and operation of the system is directly observable." (129)

## Specification of Cognitive Tasks
"The description of transformations of representational state in the previous sections is both a description of how the system processes information and a specification of cognitive tasks facing the individual members of the navigation team." (129)

## Representations are cultural
"Notice that, although some of the representations are internal, they are still all cultural in the sense that they are the residua of a process enacted by a community of practice rather than idiosyncratic inventions of their individual users." (130)

## Minimum internal structure
"In the following, I will attempt to posit the minimum internal structure required to get the task done. I choose the minimum because I would go beyond this point with trepidation [Ã„ngstlichkeit, Beklemmung]." (132)

## Cognitive Abilities for Navigation
"Indeed, the cognitive abilities that navigation practitioniers employ in their use of the forms and inscriptions are very mundane ones - abilities that are found in a thousand other task settings." (133)

## Tools
"Even more important, the incorrect relations are 'built out' - it is not possible to produce those relations with these tools." (151)

## Complex Computation
"A complex computation is realized ba a simple strategy seeing in a carefully constructed environment." (152)

## Tools: Amplifying or Transforming
"Rather than amplify the cognitive abilities of the task performers or act as intelligent agents in interaction with them, these tools transform the task the person has to do by representing it in an domain where the answer or the path to the solution is apparent." (155)

## Sequential or co-articulated
"In fact, the maximally co-articualted case is typical. [...] The serial sequential account i the one that appears in the written procedures that describe the task." (158)

## Modularity
"All these precomputational activities are instance of a wider class of computational phenomena called modularity. They are modula in the sense that they remove from local computations any apsects that are invariant across the spational and temporal extent of the computation." (167)

## Functional System performing Tasks
"Then, and always, the functional system that performs the task is a constellation of structured representational media that are brought into coordination with one another. These tools permit us to transform difficult tasks into ones that can be done by pattern matching, by the manipulation of simple physical systems, or by mental simulations of manipulations of simple physical systems. These tools are useful precisely because the cognitive processes required to manipulate them are not the computational processes accomplished by thir manipulation. The computational constraints of the problem have been built into the physical structure of the  tools." (170f)

## 4 The Organization of Team Performances

## Team Computation
"Since the work of the team is a computation, we can treat this as a computational system and treat the social organisation of the team as a computational architecture." (185)

## Buffering
"Buffering contribute to what Perrow (1984) has colled 'loose coupling' of the system." (195)

## Individual Memory
"If we think of individual memory as communication with the self over time (Lants and Stefflre 1964), then the replacement of intrapersonal communication by interpersonal communication is an expected consequence of the move from individual to team performance of a task." (196)

## Partial Procedure without Overall Pattern
"An interlocking set of partial procedures can produce the overall observed pattern without there being a representation of that overall pattern anywhere in the system." (200)

## Coordination
"When the nature of the problem is seen as coordination among persons and devices, much of the organization of behavior is removed from the performer and is given over to the structure of the object or system with which one is coordinating." (200)

## People as Glue
"The people are the glue that sticks the hardware of the system together." (202)

## Distributing attention
"When a probem has a deeply nested goal structure, a social herarchy con provide a mechanism for distributung the attention to various parts of the goal structure." (203)

## Overlapping Knowledge
"This sort of overlapping konwledge distribution is characteristic of cooperative work and is an important source of the robustness of such systems in the face of error and interruption." (221)

## Ways to Distribute
"Given a computational procedure and a social organization, there are better and worse ways to distribute the computation across the social network. One way in which the distribution of tasks can be better or worce concerns the relation between the amount of information that must be passed between computational segments and the capacity of the medium of communication between the participants responsibel for those segments." (223)

## Robustness
"This robustness is made possible by the redundant distribution of knowledge among the members of the team, the access of members to one another's activities, and the fact that the individual workloads are light enough to permit mutual monitoring and occasional assistance." (223f)

## Constraints on the Behavior
"An important aspect of these interrelated social and computational structures is that both of them provide constraints on the behavior of the participants." (224)

## What is the subject?
"'How do you know what they are doing? Maybe what they are making is social relationships and the cars are a side effect.'" (225)

## Cognitive Properties of the System
"The larger system has cognitive properties very different from those of any individual. In fact the cognitive properties of the navigation team are at least twice removed from the cognitive properties of the individual members of the team. The first remove is a result of the transfroming effects of the interactions with the tools of the trade (chapter 3); the second remove is a consequence of the social organization of distributed cognition." (226)

## 5 Communication

## Structure of Language
"When cognitive activities are distribute across social space, the language or languages used by task performers to communicate are almost certain to serve as structuring resources, and the structure of language will affect the coginitve properties of the gruop even if they do not affect the cognitive properties of individuals in the group." (232)

## Meanings
"The meanings of statements and questions are not given in the statements themselves but are negotiated by the participants in the context of their understandings of the activities underway." (236)

## Meanings
"Meanings can only even be imaginated to be in the messages when the environment about which communication is performed is very stable and there are very strong constaints on the expectations." (239)

## Cognitive Properties of Groups
"Rather, the cognitive properties of groups are produced by interaction between structures internal to individuals and structures external to individuals." (262)
