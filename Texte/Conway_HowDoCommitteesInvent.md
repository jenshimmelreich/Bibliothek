## Intitial stages of a design effort
"The intitial stages of a design effort are concerned more with structuring of the design activity than with the system itself. [...]
1. Understanding of the boundaries, [...]
2. Achievement of a prliminary notion of the system's organization. [...]" (28)

## Organized = Biazed
"Given any design team organization, there is a class of design alternatives which connot be effectivley pursued by such an organization because the necessary communication paths do not exist. Therefore, there is noch such thing as a design group which is both organized an unbiazed." (28)

## Fundamental Question
"We are now in a position to address the fundamental question  of this article: Is there any predictabel relationship between the graph structure of a design organization and the graph structure of the system it designs? The answer is: Yes, the relationship so simple that in some cases is an identity." (29)

## Organization and Flexibility
"To the extent that an organization is not completely flexible in its communiction structure, that organization will stamp out an image of itself in every design it produces." (30)

## Disintegration
"Why do large systems disintegrate? [...]
Second, application of the conventional wisdom of management to a large design organization causes its communication structure ot disintegrate.
Third, the homomorphism insure that the structure of the system will reflect the disintegration which has occurred in the design organization." (31)

## Basic Thesis
"The basic thesis of this article is that organizations which design systems (in the broad sense used here) are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structres of these organizations." (31)

## Criterion for Structering of design activities
"Primarily, we have found a criterion for the structuring of design organizations: a design effort should be organized according to the need for communication." (31)
