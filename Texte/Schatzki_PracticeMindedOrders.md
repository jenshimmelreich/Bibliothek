Social Practices and Mind
-------------------------
"This essay defends two principal theses: (1) that social order is established within the sway [Herrschaft, Schwung] of social practices, and (2) that mind is a central dimension of this 'process'. ... It is the role that a socially constituted mind plays in structuring practices that certifies practices as the place of social order."
(42)

Meaning - Arrangement
---------------------
"This thesis simply avers [behaupten, unterstellen] that people (and some organisms) possess [haben, besitzen] identities, and that artifacts, things, organisms, and people bear meanings as elements of arrangements."
(43f.)

Discourse - practice
--------------------
"Erupting [auftreten, ausbrechen] from a discourse that imparts [verteilen] to it form, practice dislocates existing positions (meanings) by rearticulating them, thereby establishing transformed discourses." [Paraphrase of Laclau and Mouffe]
(45)

Social orders - Practices
-------------------------
"My overall argumment is, thus, that social orders are established within the sway of social practices because practices mold [formen, gestalten] the forms of determination that are responsible for them."
(46f.)

Practical Intelligibility
-------------------------
"I call the state of affairs that action makes sense to someone to do 'practical intelligibility'. People almost always, I contend, do what makes sense to them to do; more elaborately, they are almost always performing bodily doings that, in the current circumstances, constitute the actions that make sense to them to perform."
(47)

Practical Intelligibility
-------------------------
"As will be discussed in the third section, practical intelligibility is determined by the mental phenomena of teleology and affectivity, by orientations toward ends and by how things meatter."
(47)

Practices and Social Orders
---------------------------
"Practices form the chief context of social orders by moldig action and meaning - that is, by helping to shape the practical intelligibility that governs activity and by carrying that, in accordance with which the meanings of arranged entities are instituted."
(48)

Practices
---------
"Each, as an organized web of activity, exhibits two overall dimensions: activity and organization."
(48)

Mental States
-------------
"As these formulations suggest, mental states, instead of being objects or processes, are _states of affairs_ that obtain [gelten] with respect to a person: that such and such is annoying [lästig, störend], the case, or something to possess or realize. Such states are how things stand or are goring for that person in his or her involvement in the world."
(49)

Mental States
-------------
"One important feature of mental states so conceived is that they are _expressed_ in behavior, where 'expressed' means that behavior manifests or signifies them (as when joy is manifested in crying and belief in God is signified by praying). A second important feature is that these states do not inform [anregen] activity by causing it. Rather, they inform activity by determining what makes sense to people to do."
(49)

Mind
----
"The important point is that mind need not be conceptualized as a thing or apparatus that causes behavior."
(50)

Mind
----
"Hence [daher], they fail to refute the possibility that mind is a medium through which the activities that compose a practice are _noncausally_ organized."
(50)

Actions
-------
"The actions that compose agiven practice, consequently, are linked by the cross-referencing and interdependent know-hows that they express concerning their performance, identification, instigation [Auffordern], and response."
(51)

Practical Intelligibility
-------------------------
"Practical intelligibility, however, is primarily determined, not by understanding, but by rules, teleology, and affectivity."
(51)

Actions composing a Practices
-----------------------------
"So the actions composing a practice are linked, second, through the collection of rules that they observe; more precisely, through understandings of these rules that they express."
(52)

Teleological and Affective Determination
----------------------------------------
"In ways such as this, all mental determinations of practical intelligibility can be cashed out teleologically and affectively - and, conversely, all teleological and affective determination of intelligibility can be cashed out mentally."
(52)

Mind as a Medium
----------------
"Since, furthermore, the organizing phenomena resolve into mental conditions, mind is a 'medium' through which practices are organized."
(53)
